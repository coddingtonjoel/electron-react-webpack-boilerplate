## Minimal Electron, React, and Webpack Boilerplate (with Sass)

Minimal Electron, React, PostCSS and Webpack boilerplate to help you get started with building your next app.

Forked from Alex Devero's repo and mixed with ideas from Brad Traversy's simple-electron-react boilerplate.
Implements Sass architecture and includes a separate menu file so main.js doesn't get too cluttered.

### Add Sass

Adding Sass to boilerplate requires updating webpack configs and adding necessary loaders.

1. To `webpack.build.config.js` and `webpack.dev.config.js` add new object to `rules`:

```JavaScript
{
  test: /\.scss$/,
  use: [
    { loader: 'style-loader' },
    { loader: 'css-loader' },
    { loader: 'sass-loader' }],
  include: defaultInclude
}
```

2. Install additional loaders for sass, `sass-loader` and `node-sass`.

3. Rename all CSS file to `.scss`.

### Change app title

This boilerplate uses [HTML Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#options) to generate the HTML file of the app. Changing app title is possible only through webpack configs, `webpack.build.config.js` and `webpack.dev.config.js`. App title can be changed by adding objects of options.

In `webpack.build.config.js`:

```JavaScript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({title: 'New app title '}),// Add this (line 41)
  new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
    // Options similar to the same options in webpackOptions.output
    // both options are optional
    filename: 'bundle.css',
    chunkFilename: '[id].css'
  }),
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
  }),
  new BabiliPlugin()
],
```

In `webpack.dev.config.js`:

```JavaScript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({title: 'New app title '}),// Add this (line 36)
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('development')
  })
],
```
